# Curvature

* All the ways in which curvature manifests itself rely on something called "connection", 
which gives us a way of relating vectors in the tangent spaces of nearby points. There is 
a unique connection that we can construct from metric, and it is encapsulated in an object 
called the *Christoffel symbol*, given by
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{2}g^{\lambda\sigma}
    (\partial_{\mu}g_{\nu\sigma} + \partial_{\nu}g_{\sigma\mu} - \partial_{\sigma}g_{\mu\nu})
  \end{gather}
  $$
  The notation make $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ look like a tensor, but in fact it is not.

## Covariant derivative

* What we would like is a covariant derivative, that is, an operator that reduces to the partial
derivative in flat space with inertial coordinates, but transforms as a tensor on an abitrary
manifold.

* It should be noted that the partial derivative $\partial_{\mu}$ is actually a tensor but only belongs to
flat manifold.

* Covariant derivative $\nabla$ is a map from $(k, l)$ tensor fields, to $(k, l+1)$ tensor fields
which has these properties:
  1. linearity: $\nabla(T + S) = \nabla T + \nabla S$
  2. Leibniz rule: $\nabla(T \otimes S) = (\nabla T) \otimes S + T \otimes (\nabla S)$
  3. commutes with contractions: 
  $\nabla_{\mu}(T^{\lambda}_{\phantom{\lambda}\lambda\rho}) = {(\nabla T)_{\mu}}^{\lambda}_{\phantom{\lambda}\lambda\rho}$
  4. reduces to partial derivative on scalars: $\nabla_{\mu}\phi = \partial_{\mu}\phi$

* If $\nabla$ is going to obey the Leibniz rule, it can always be written as the partial derivative
  plus some linear transformation. Consider the covariant derivative of a vector $V^{\mu}$, we have
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\mu\nu} =
    \frac{1}{2}g^{\sigma\rho}
    (\partial_{\mu}g_{\nu\rho} + \partial_{\nu}g_{\rho\mu} - \partial_{\rho}g_{\mu\nu})
  \end{gather}
  $$
  Because the *Christoffel symbol* is not a tensor, it do not obey the tensor transformation law: 
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \Gamma^{\nu^\prime}_{\mu^\prime\lambda^\prime} = 
    \frac{\partial x^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\mu^\prime}}
    \frac{\partial x^{\lambda}}{\partial x^{\lambda^\prime}}
    \frac{\partial x^{\nu^\prime}}{\partial x^{\nu}}
    \Gamma^{\nu}_{\mu\lambda} - 
    \frac{\partial x^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\mu^\prime}}
    \frac{\partial x^{\lambda}}{\partial x^{\lambda^\prime}}
    \frac{\partial^2 x^{\nu^\prime}}{\partial x^{\mu}\partial x^{\lambda}}
  \end{gather}
  $$

* The Kronecker delta is covariant constant, $\nabla_{\mu}\delta^{\rho}_{\lambda}=0$: 

  For any $(1, 0)$ tensor $v^{\rho} \in M$, we have $v^{\rho} = \delta^{\rho}_{\lambda}v^{\lambda} = 
  C(\delta^{\rho}_{\sigma}v^{\lambda})$, where $C$ represent the contraction of $\sigma$ and $\lambda$,
  then
  $$
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{align*}
      \nabla_{\mu}v^{\rho} &= \nabla_{\mu}(\delta^{\rho}_{\lambda}v^{\lambda})
      \\ &= \nabla_{\mu}[C(\delta^{\rho}_{\sigma}v^{\lambda})]
      \\ &= C[\nabla_{\mu}(\delta^{\rho}_{\sigma}v^{\lambda})]
      \\ &= C[v^{\lambda}\nabla_{\mu}\delta^{\rho}_{\sigma} + \delta^{\rho}_{\sigma}\nabla_{\mu}v^{\lambda}]
      \\ &= v^{\lambda}\nabla_{\mu}\delta^{\rho}_{\lambda} + \nabla_{\mu}v^{\rho}
    \end{align*}
  \end{equation}
  $$
  finally we can find that, for every $v^{\lambda}$, $\nabla_{\mu}\delta^{\rho}_{\lambda}=0$.
  
  It should note that we can get the above result simplifily,
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \nabla_{\mu}v^{\rho} = \nabla_{\mu}(\delta^{\rho}_{\lambda}v^{\lambda}) =
    v^{\lambda}\nabla_{\mu}\delta^{\rho}_{\lambda} + \delta^{\rho}_{\lambda}\nabla_{\mu}v^{\lambda}
  \end{gather}
  $$

* It is similar to the covariant derivative of $\nabla_{\mu}V^{\nu}$, the covariant derivative of one-form
$\nabla_{\mu}\omega_{\nu}$ use the same connection coefficients as  were used for the vector, but now with
a minus sign and indices matched up somewhat differently:
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \nabla_{\mu}\omega_{\nu} = \partial_{\mu}\omega_{\nu} - \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}\omega_{\lambda}
  \end{gather}
  $$

* With these we can take the covariant derivative of a tensor of abitrary rank straightforward:
  $$
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{align*}
      \nabla_{\sigma}T^{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}_{\phantom{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}\nu_1\nu_2 ... \nu_l}
      &= \partial_{\sigma}T^{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}_{\phantom{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}\nu_1\nu_2 ... \nu_l}
      \\ &\phantom{=}+ \Gamma^{\mu_1}_{\sigma\lambda}T^{\lambda\mu_2 ... \mu_k}_{\phantom{\lambda\mu_2 ... \mu_k}\nu_1\nu_2 ... \nu_l}
         + \Gamma^{\mu_2}_{\sigma\lambda}T^{\mu_1\lambda ... \mu_k}_{\phantom{\mu_1\lambda ... \mu_k}\nu_1\nu_2 ... \nu_l}
         ...
         + \Gamma^{\mu_k}_{\sigma\lambda}T^{\mu1\mu_2 ... \lambda}_{\phantom{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \lambda}\nu_1\nu_2 ... \nu_l}
      \\ &\phantom{=}- \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\sigma\nu_1}T^{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}_{\phantom{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}\lambda\nu_2 ... \nu_l}
         - \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\sigma\nu_2}T^{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}_{\phantom{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}\nu_1\lambda ... \nu_l}
         ...
         - \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\sigma\nu_l}T^{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}_{\phantom{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}\nu_1\nu_2 ... \lambda}
    \end{align*}
  \end{equation}
  $$

* **The name  *connection* comes from the fact that it is used to transport vectors from one tangent
space to another, as we will soon see; it is sometimes used to refer to the operator $\nabla$, and
sometimes to the coefficients $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$.**

* We could define a large number of connections on any manifold and each of them implies a distinct
notion of covariant differentiation. In general relativity this freedom is not a big concern, because
it turns out that every metric defines a unique connection, which is the one used in GR.

* Given a connection specified by $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$, we can immediately form another connection
simply by permuting the lower indices. That is, the set of coefficients $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\nu\mu}$ will
also transform according to equation (3), so they determine a distinct connection. There is thus a tensor
we can associate with any given connection, known as the **torsion tensor**, defined by
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    T^{\lambda}_{\phantom{\lambda}\mu\nu}
    = \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu} - \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\nu\mu}
    = 2\Gamma^{\lambda}_{[\mu\nu]}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  It is clear that the torsion is antisymmetric in its lower indices, and a connection that is symmetric in
  its lower indices is known as "torsion-free".

* We can now define a unique connection on a manifold with a metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ by introducing two
additional properties:
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \nabla_{\lambda}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} = 0
  \end{gather}
  $$
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \nabla_{\rho}g^{\mu\nu} = 0
  \end{gather}
  $$
  That is
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\mu\nu} =
    \frac{1}{2}g^{\sigma\rho}
    (\partial_{\mu}g_{\nu\rho} + \partial_{\nu}g_{\rho\mu} - \partial_{\rho}g_{\mu\nu})
  \end{gather}
  $$
  This connection is the one on which conventional general relativity is based. It is known by
  different names: sometimes the **Christoffel** connection, sometimes the **Levi-Civita** connection,
  sometimes the **Riemannian** connection.

### Exercise

* Calculate the covariant divergence of a vector $V^{\mu}$:\
  The covariant divergence of $V^{\mu}$ is given by
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \nabla_{\mu}V^{\mu} = \partial_{\mu}V^{\mu} + \Gamma^{\mu}_{\mu\lambda}V^{\lambda}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  $\Gamma^{\mu}_{\mu\lambda}$ is written as:
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \Gamma^{\mu}_{\mu\lambda} =
    \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\rho}
    (\partial_{\mu}g_{\lambda\rho} + \partial_{\lambda}g_{\rho\mu} - \partial_{\rho}g_{\mu\lambda})
  \end{gather}
  $$
  Since the metric and its inverse are symmetry, terms of $\partial_{\mu}g_{\lambda\rho}$ and
  $\partial_{\rho}g_{\mu\lambda}$ will cancel each other out eventually, then
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \Gamma^{\mu}_{\mu\lambda} =
    \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\rho}\partial_{\lambda}g_{\rho\mu}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  One should note that the determinant of the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ is $|g|$ and can be expanded as the
  sum of the elements of $\mu$-th row multiply their algebraic cofactor $A^{\mu\rho}$:
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    |g| = g_{\mu\rho}A^{\mu\rho}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  so $\partial_{\lambda}|g| = A^{\mu\rho}\partial_{\lambda}g_{\mu\rho}$, and
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \partial_{\lambda}g_{\rho\mu} = \frac{\partial_{\lambda}|g|}{A^{\rho\mu}}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  $g^{\mu\rho}$ as an element of $1/|g|$ can be written as
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    g^{\mu\rho} = \frac{A^{\rho\mu}}{|g|}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  so
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \Gamma^{\mu}_{\mu\lambda} =
    \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\rho}\partial_{\lambda}g_{\rho\mu} =
    \frac{1}{2|g|}\partial_{\lambda}|g| =
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\partial_{\lambda}\sqrt{|g|}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  and we therefore obtain
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \nabla_{\mu}V^{\mu} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\partial_{\mu}(\sqrt{|g|}V^{\mu})
  \end{gather}
  $$

* The exterior derivative and the vector-field commutator are both well-defined(at the
point of view of tensor) in terms of partials, essentially because both involve an
antisymmetrization that cancels the nontensorial piece of the partial derivative
transformation law. The same feature implies that they could, on the other hand, be
equally well-defined in terms of(torsion-free) covariant derivative:
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    (d\omega)_{\mu\nu} = 2\partial_{\lbrack\mu}\omega_{\nu\rbrack} =
    2\nabla_{\lbrack\mu}\omega_{\nu\rbrack}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  and
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    [X, Y]^{\mu} =
    X^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}Y^{\mu} - Y^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}X^{\mu} =
    X^{\lambda}\nabla_{\lambda}Y^{\mu} - Y^{\lambda}\nabla_{\lambda}X^{\mu}
  \end{gather}
  $$

## Parallel transport and geodesics

* The covariant derivative quantifies the instantaneous rate of change of a tensor field in
comparision to what the tensor would be if it were "parallel transported". In other worlds,
a connection defines a specific way of keeping a tensor constant(along some path), on the basis
of which we can compare nearby tensor.

* The concept of moving a vector along a path, keeping constant all the while, is known as parallel
transport. In a curved space, the result of parallel transporting a vector from one point to another
will depend on the path taken between the points. Parallel transport is supposed to be the curved-space
generalization of the concept of "keeping the tensor constant" as we move it along a path. The rigorous
definition of this is
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \frac{D}{d\lambda}T^{\mu_1\mu_2...\mu_k}_{\phantom{\mu_1\mu_2...\mu_k}\nu_1\nu_2...\nu_l} \equiv
    \frac{dx^{\sigma}}{d\lambda}\nabla_{\sigma}
    T^{\mu_1\mu_2...\mu_k}_{\phantom{\mu_1\mu_2...\mu_k}\nu_1\nu_2...\nu_l} =
    0
  \end{gather}
  $$
  known as the **equation of parallel transport**. For a vector it takes the form
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \frac{d}{d\lambda}V^{\mu} + \Gamma^{\mu}_{\sigma\rho}\frac{dx^{\sigma}}{d\lambda}V^{\rho} = 0
  \end{gather}
  $$

* A geodesic is a curve along which the tangent vector is parallel-transported, that is
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \frac{D}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\lambda} = 0
  \end{gather}
  $$
  or alternatively
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \frac{d^2x^{\mu}}{d\lambda^2} +
    \Gamma^{\mu}_{\rho\sigma}\frac{dx^{\rho}}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^{\sigma}}{d\lambda} = 0
  \end{gather}
  $$
  This is the **geodesic equation**. In flat space, $\Gamma^{\mu}_{\rho\sigma}=0$ and the
  geodesic equation reduce to $d^2x^{\mu}/d\lambda^2=0$, which is exactly the equation for
  a straight line.

### The deifinition of geodesic at the point of view of curve with shortest distance between two points in manifold

  * At the begining of introduce this, let's look at the so-called **twin paradox**:\
    First, the notation of proper time is $\tau$ which satisfies
    $$
    \begin{gather}
      (\Delta\tau)^2 = -(\Delta s)^2 = -\eta_{\mu\nu}\Delta x^{\mu}\Delta x^{\nu}
    \end{gather}
    $$
    **A crucial feature of the spacetime interval is that the proper time between two
    events measures the time elapsed as seen by an observer moving on a straight path
    between the events**. This is easily seen in the very special case that the two
    events have the same spatial coordinates, and are only separated in time; this
    corresponds to the observer traveling between the events being at rest in the
    coordinates system used. Then $(\Delta\tau)^2 = -\eta_{\mu\nu}\Delta x^{\mu}
    \Delta x^{\nu} = (\Delta t)^2$. So $\Delta \tau = \Delta t$, and of course we
    define $t$ as the time measured by a clock located at a fixed spatial position.

    <ComImg alt="双子谬论" src={ TwinParadoxImg } width="300"></ComImg>

    A crucial fact is that, for more general trajectories, the proper time and coordinate
    time are different. Consider two trajectories between events $A$ and $C$, one a straight
    line passing through a halfway point marked $B$, and another traveled by an observer
    moving away from $A$ at a constant velocity $v=dx/dt$ to a point $B^{\prime}$ and then
    back at a constant velocity $-v$ to intersect at the event $C$. Choose inertial coordinates
    such that the straight trajectory describes a motionless particle, with event $A$ located at
    $(t, x)=(0, 0)$ and $C$ located at $(\Delta t, 0)$. The two paths then describe an isosceles
    triangle in spacetime; $B$ has coordinates $(\frac{1}{2}\Delta t, 0)$ and $B^{\prime}$ has
    coordinates $(\frac{1}{2}\Delta t, \Delta x)$, with $\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}v\Delta t$.
    Clearly, $\Delta \tau_{AB} = \frac{1}{2}\Delta t$, but
    $$
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{align*}
        \Delta \tau_{AB^{\prime}}
        &= \sqrt{(\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)^2 - (\Delta x)^2}
        \\&= \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1 - v^2} \Delta t
      \end{align*}
    \end{equation}
    $$
    It should be obvious that $\tau_{BC}=\tau_{AB}$ and $\tau_{B^{\prime}C}=\tau_{AB^{\prime}}$.
    Thus, the observer on the straight-line trip from event $A$ to $C$ experiences an elapsed
    time of $\tau_{ABC} = \Delta t$, whereas the one who traveled out and returned experiences
    $$
    \begin{gather}
      \tau_{AB^{\prime}C} = \sqrt{1 - v^2} \Delta t \lt \Delta t
    \end{gather}
    $$
    Even though the two observers begin and end at the same points in spacetime, they have aged
    different amounts. This is the famous "twin paradox". The truth is straightforward: a nonstraight
    path in spacetime has a different interval than a straight path.
    
  * Now let's begin to do the calculation and in the name of simplicity we will do it just for a
    timelike path - the resulting equation will turn out to be good for any path, so we are not
    losing any generality. We therefore consider the proper time functional,
    $$
    \begin{gather}
      \tau = \int \bigg(
      -g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\lambda}
      \bigg)^{1/2} d\lambda
    \end{gather}
    $$
    where the inegral is over the path. Mark $g_{\mu\nu}(dx^{\mu}/d\lambda)(dx^{\nu}/d\lambda)$
    as $f$ and do the usual calculus-of-variations treatment to seek critical points of this
    functional:
    $$
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{align*}
        \delta\tau &= \int \delta\sqrt{-f}d\lambda
        \\&= -\int \frac{1}{2}(-f)^{-1/2}\delta f d\lambda
      \end{align*}
    \end{equation}
    $$
    It makes thing easier if we now specify that our parameter is the proper time itself, rather
    than the abitrary parameter $\lambda$. This fixes the value of $f$,
    $$
    \begin{gather}
      f = g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau} = 1
    \end{gather}
    $$
    From `(30)` we then have
    $$
    \begin{gather}
      \delta\tau = -\frac{1}{2}\int \delta f d\tau
    \end{gather}
    $$
    Consider the change in the integral under infinitesimal variations of path,
    $$
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{gather*}
        x^{\mu} \to x^{\mu} + \delta x^{\mu} \\
        g_{\mu\nu} \to g_{\mu\nu} + (\partial_{\sigma}g_{\mu\nu})\delta x^{\sigma}
      \end{gather*}
    \end{equation}
    $$
    Use `(33)` into `(32)` and keeping only terms first-order in $\delta x^{\mu}$, we get
    $$
    \begin{gather}
      \delta\tau = -\frac{1}{2}\int\bigg[
        \partial_{\sigma}g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\delta x^{\sigma} +
        g_{\mu\nu}\frac{d(\delta x^{\mu})}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau} +
        g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\frac{d(\delta x^{\nu})}{d\tau}
      \bigg]d\tau
    \end{gather}
    $$
    where we use the result that
    $$
    \begin{gather}
      \delta\bigg(\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\bigg) =
      \frac{d(x^{\mu} + \delta x^{\mu})}{d\tau} - \frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau} =
      \frac{d(\delta x^{\mu})}{d\tau}
    \end{gather}
    $$
    The last two terms of `(34)` can be integrated by parts; for example,
    $$
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{align*}
        -\frac{1}{2}\int\bigg[
          g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\frac{d(\delta x^{\nu})}{d\tau}
        \bigg]d\tau &= -\frac{1}{2}\int \frac{d}{d\tau}\bigg[
          g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\delta x^{\mu}
        \bigg] d\tau +
        \frac{1}{2}\int\bigg[
          g_{\mu\nu}\frac{d^2x^{\mu}}{d\tau^2} + \frac{dg_{\mu\nu}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}
        \bigg]\delta x^{\nu}d\tau
        \\& = \frac{1}{2}\int\bigg[
          g_{\mu\nu}\frac{d^2x^{\mu}}{d\tau^2} +
          \partial_{\sigma}g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^{\sigma}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}
        \bigg]\delta x^{\nu}d\tau
      \end{align*}
    \end{equation}
    $$
    where the boundary terms vanish because we take our variation $\delta x^{\mu}$ to vanish
    at the endpoints of the path. The variation `(34)` then becomes, after rearranging some
    dummy indices,
    $$
    \begin{gather}
      \delta\tau = \int\bigg[
        g_{\mu\sigma}\frac{d^2x^{\mu}}{d\tau^2} +
        \frac{1}{2}(\partial_{\mu}g_{\nu\sigma} + \partial_{\nu}g_{\sigma\mu} - \partial_{\sigma}g_{\mu\nu})
        \frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}
      \bigg]\delta x^{\sigma}d\tau
    \end{gather}
    $$
    Since we are searching for stationary points, we want $\delta\tau$ to vanish for
    any variation $\delta x^{\sigma}$; this implies
    $$
    \begin{gather}
      g_{\mu\sigma}\frac{d^2x^{\mu}}{d\tau^2} +
      \frac{1}{2}(\partial_{\mu}g_{\nu\sigma} + \partial_{\nu}g_{\sigma\mu} - \partial_{\sigma}g_{\mu\nu})
      \frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau} = 0
    \end{gather}
    $$
    and multiplying by the inverse metric $g^{\rho\sigma}$ finally leads to
    $$
    \begin{gather}
      \frac{d^2x^{\rho}}{d\tau^2} +
      \frac{1}{2}g^{\rho\sigma}(\partial_{\mu}g_{\nu\sigma} + \partial_{\nu}g_{\sigma\mu} - \partial_{\sigma}g_{\mu\nu})
      \frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau} = 0
    \end{gather}
    $$
    We see that this is precisely the geodesic equation `(25)`, but with the specific choice
    of Christoffel connection `(11)`.
