# Curvature

* All the ways in which curvature manifests itself rely on something called "connection", 
which gives us a way of relating vectors in the tangent spaces of nearby points. There is 
a unique connection that we can construct from metric, and it is encapsulated in an object 
called the *Christoffel symbol*, given by
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{2}g^{\lambda\sigma}
    (\partial_{\mu}g_{\nu\sigma} + \partial_{\nu}g_{\sigma\mu} - \partial_{\sigma}g_{\mu\nu})
  \end{gather}
  $$
  The notation make $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ look like a tensor, but in fact it is not.

## Covariant derivative

* What we would like is a covariant derivative, that is, an operator that reduces to the partial
derivative in flat space with inertial coordinates, but transforms as a tensor on an abitrary
manifold.

* It should be noted that the partial derivative $\partial_{\mu}$ is actually a tensor but only belongs to
flat manifold.

* Covariant derivative $\nabla$ is a map from $(k, l)$ tensor fields, to $(k, l+1)$ tensor fields
which has these properties:
  1. linearity: $\nabla(T + S) = \nabla T + \nabla S$
  2. Leibniz rule: $\nabla(T \otimes S) = (\nabla T) \otimes S + T \otimes (\nabla S)$
  3. commutes with contractions: 
  $\nabla_{\mu}(T^{\lambda}_{\phantom{\lambda}\lambda\rho}) = {(\nabla T)_{\mu}}^{\lambda}_{\phantom{\lambda}\lambda\rho}$
  4. reduces to partial derivative on scalars: $\nabla_{\mu}\phi = \partial_{\mu}\phi$

* If $\nabla$ is going to obey the Leibniz rule, it can always be written as the partial derivative
  plus some linear transformation. Consider the covariant derivative of a vector $V^{\mu}$, we have
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\mu\nu} =
    \frac{1}{2}g^{\sigma\rho}
    (\partial_{\mu}g_{\nu\rho} + \partial_{\nu}g_{\rho\mu} - \partial_{\rho}g_{\mu\nu})
  \end{gather}
  $$
  Because the *Christoffel symbol* is not a tensor, it do not obey the tensor transformation law: 
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \Gamma^{\nu^\prime}_{\mu^\prime\lambda^\prime} = 
    \frac{\partial x^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\mu^\prime}}
    \frac{\partial x^{\lambda}}{\partial x^{\lambda^\prime}}
    \frac{\partial x^{\nu^\prime}}{\partial x^{\nu}}
    \Gamma^{\nu}_{\mu\lambda} - 
    \frac{\partial x^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\mu^\prime}}
    \frac{\partial x^{\lambda}}{\partial x^{\lambda^\prime}}
    \frac{\partial^2 x^{\nu^\prime}}{\partial x^{\mu}\partial x^{\lambda}}
  \end{gather}
  $$

* The Kronecker delta is covariant constant, $\nabla_{\mu}\delta^{\rho}_{\lambda}=0$: 

  For any $(1, 0)$ tensor $v^{\rho} \in M$, we have $v^{\rho} = \delta^{\rho}_{\lambda}v^{\lambda} = 
  C(\delta^{\rho}_{\sigma}v^{\lambda})$, where $C$ represent the contraction of $\sigma$ and $\lambda$,
  then
  $$
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{align*}
      \nabla_{\mu}v^{\rho} &= \nabla_{\mu}(\delta^{\rho}_{\lambda}v^{\lambda})
      \\ &= \nabla_{\mu}[C(\delta^{\rho}_{\sigma}v^{\lambda})]
      \\ &= C[\nabla_{\mu}(\delta^{\rho}_{\sigma}v^{\lambda})]
      \\ &= C[v^{\lambda}\nabla_{\mu}\delta^{\rho}_{\sigma} + \delta^{\rho}_{\sigma}\nabla_{\mu}v^{\lambda}]
      \\ &= v^{\lambda}\nabla_{\mu}\delta^{\rho}_{\lambda} + \nabla_{\mu}v^{\rho}
    \end{align*}
  \end{equation}
  $$
  finally we can find that, for every $v^{\lambda}$, $\nabla_{\mu}\delta^{\rho}_{\lambda}=0$.
  
  It should note that we can get the above result simplifily,
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \nabla_{\mu}v^{\rho} = \nabla_{\mu}(\delta^{\rho}_{\lambda}v^{\lambda}) =
    v^{\lambda}\nabla_{\mu}\delta^{\rho}_{\lambda} + \delta^{\rho}_{\lambda}\nabla_{\mu}v^{\lambda}
  \end{gather}
  $$

* It is similar to the covariant derivative of $\nabla_{\mu}V^{\nu}$, the covariant derivative of one-form
$\nabla_{\mu}\omega_{\nu}$ use the same connection coefficients as  were used for the vector, but now with
a minus sign and indices matched up somewhat differently:
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \nabla_{\mu}\omega_{\nu} = \partial_{\mu}\omega_{\nu} - \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}\omega_{\lambda}
  \end{gather}
  $$

* With these we can take the covariant derivative of a tensor of abitrary rank straightforward:
  $$
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{align*}
      \nabla_{\sigma}T^{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}_{\phantom{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}\nu_1\nu_2 ... \nu_l}
      &= \partial_{\sigma}T^{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}_{\phantom{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}\nu_1\nu_2 ... \nu_l}
      \\ &\phantom{=}+ \Gamma^{\mu_1}_{\sigma\lambda}T^{\lambda\mu_2 ... \mu_k}_{\phantom{\lambda\mu_2 ... \mu_k}\nu_1\nu_2 ... \nu_l}
         + \Gamma^{\mu_2}_{\sigma\lambda}T^{\mu_1\lambda ... \mu_k}_{\phantom{\mu_1\lambda ... \mu_k}\nu_1\nu_2 ... \nu_l}
         ...
         + \Gamma^{\mu_k}_{\sigma\lambda}T^{\mu1\mu_2 ... \lambda}_{\phantom{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \lambda}\nu_1\nu_2 ... \nu_l}
      \\ &\phantom{=}- \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\sigma\nu_1}T^{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}_{\phantom{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}\lambda\nu_2 ... \nu_l}
         - \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\sigma\nu_2}T^{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}_{\phantom{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}\nu_1\lambda ... \nu_l}
         ...
         - \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\sigma\nu_l}T^{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}_{\phantom{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_k}\nu_1\nu_2 ... \lambda}
    \end{align*}
  \end{equation}
  $$

* **The name  *connection* comes from the fact that it is used to transport vectors from one tangent
space to another, as we will soon see; it is sometimes used to refer to the operator $\nabla$, and
sometimes to the coefficients $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$.**

* We could define a large number of connections on any manifold and each of them implies a distinct
notion of covariant differentiation. In general relativity this freedom is not a big concern, because
it turns out that every metric defines a unique connection, which is the one used in GR.

* Given a connection specified by $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$, we can immediately form another connection
simply by permuting the lower indices. That is, the set of coefficients $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\nu\mu}$ will
also transform according to equation (3), so they determine a distinct connection. There is thus a tensor
we can associate with any given connection, known as the **torsion tensor**, defined by
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    T^{\lambda}_{\phantom{\lambda}\mu\nu}
    = \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu} - \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\nu\mu}
    = 2\Gamma^{\lambda}_{[\mu\nu]}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  It is clear that the torsion is antisymmetric in its lower indices, and a connection that is symmetric in
  its lower indices is known as "torsion-free".

* We can now define a unique connection on a manifold with a metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ by introducing two
additional properties:
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \nabla_{\lambda}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} = 0
  \end{gather}
  $$
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \nabla_{\rho}g^{\mu\nu} = 0
  \end{gather}
  $$
  That is
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\mu\nu} =
    \frac{1}{2}g^{\sigma\rho}
    (\partial_{\mu}g_{\nu\rho} + \partial_{\nu}g_{\rho\mu} - \partial_{\rho}g_{\mu\nu})
  \end{gather}
  $$
  This connection is the one on which conventional general relativity is based. It is known by
  different names: sometimes the **Christoffel** connection, sometimes the **Levi-Civita** connection,
  sometimes the **Riemannian** connection.

### Exercise

* Calculate the covariant divergence of a vector $V^{\mu}$:\
  The covariant divergence of $V^{\mu}$ is given by
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \nabla_{\mu}V^{\mu} = \partial_{\mu}V^{\mu} + \Gamma^{\mu}_{\mu\lambda}V^{\lambda}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  $\Gamma^{\mu}_{\mu\lambda}$ is written as:
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \Gamma^{\mu}_{\mu\lambda} =
    \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\rho}
    (\partial_{\mu}g_{\lambda\rho} + \partial_{\lambda}g_{\rho\mu} - \partial_{\rho}g_{\mu\lambda})
  \end{gather}
  $$
  Since the metric and its inverse are symmetry, terms of $\partial_{\mu}g_{\lambda\rho}$ and
  $\partial_{\rho}g_{\mu\lambda}$ will cancel each other out eventually, then
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \Gamma^{\mu}_{\mu\lambda} =
    \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\rho}\partial_{\lambda}g_{\rho\mu}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  One should note that the determinant of the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ is $|g|$ and can be expanded as the
  sum of the elements of $\mu$-th row mutiply their algebraic cofactor $A^{\mu\rho}$:
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    |g| = g_{\mu\rho}A^{\mu\rho}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  so $\partial_{\lambda}|g| = A^{\mu\rho}\partial_{\lambda}g_{\mu\rho}$, and
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \partial_{\lambda}g_{\rho\mu} = \frac{\partial_{\lambda}|g|}{A^{\rho\mu}}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  $g^{\mu\rho}$ as an element of $1/|g|$ can be written as
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    g^{\mu\rho} = \frac{A^{\rho\mu}}{|g|}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  so
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \Gamma^{\mu}_{\mu\lambda} =
    \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\rho}\partial_{\lambda}g_{\rho\mu} =
    \frac{1}{2|g|}\partial_{\lambda}|g| =
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\partial_{\lambda}\sqrt{|g|}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  and we therefore obtain
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    \nabla_{\mu}V^{\mu} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\partial_{\mu}(\sqrt{|g|}V^{\mu})
  \end{gather}
  $$

* The exterior derivative and the vector-field commutator are both well-defined(at the
point of view of tensor) in terms of partials, essentially because both involve an
antisymmetrization that cancels the nontensorial piece of the partial derivative
transformation law. The same feature implies that they could, on the other hand, be
equally well-defined in terms of(torsion-free) covariant derivative:
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    (d\omega)_{\mu\nu} = 2\partial_{\lbrack\mu}\omega_{\nu\rbrack}
  \end{gather}
  $$
  and
  $$
  \begin{gather}
    [X, Y]^{\mu} =
    X^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}Y^{\mu} - Y^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}X^{\mu} =
    X^{\lambda}\nabla_{\lambda}Y^{\mu} - Y^{\lambda}\nabla_{\lambda}X^{\mu}
  \end{gather}
  $$

## Parallel transport and geodesics

* The covariant derivative quantifies the instantaneous rate of change of a tensor field in
comparision to what the tensor would be if it were "parallel transported". In other worlds,
a connection defines a specific way of keeping a tensor constant(along some path), on the basis
of which we can compare nearby tensor.
